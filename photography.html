        <p><strong>Photography</strong> is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,
            either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
            material such as photographic film.
        </p>
        <p>The word <strong>"photography"</strong> was created from the Greek roots φωτός (phōtós),
            genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light" and γραφή (graphé) "representation by means of lines"
            or "drawing", together meaning "drawing with light".</p>
